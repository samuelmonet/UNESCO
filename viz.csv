Honestly, I do not leave this system because I need all my hardships per day because I suffer from 13 people from my family - It was in a decision that my brother and I made, who helps us with household expenses, that I work in Yemen for daily expenses and pay attention to the house, and my brother emigrates to Saudi Arabia for the monthly expenses. I was the one who worked in Yemen and was responsible for the daily expenses, so I worked in the restoration with the fund for three days, but they charged us with half of the pain of 3000 thousand, and these three thousand, God gave you, is there enough money for 13 people in the house, who are my mother, my brothers, my sisters, my brother’s wife, and my nephews and nieces . I went through hard times in these three days and was confused as to where to pay my family’s expenses because 3000 thousand were not enough for them per day, so I had to leave the restoration work with the organization and the fund because of the daily wage system and started a job with another contractor. - And when I came to claim my dues, which they had during the three working days, of which 9000 thousand were the rest that were accruing to them for the three working days, they said, “Come at the end of the month so that you can take it.” Honestly, I could not count the entitlement because we continued to be busy. I dispensed with the rest of the wage from my hardships and forgave them. * If they were charged for the entire mishap day (the full daily wage), there would have been a change in my life. As for half of the misfortune, there was no change in my life, and for this reason I was forced to quit work of my own accord.
